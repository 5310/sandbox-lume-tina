- Deno has come a long way, but there are still issues
  - Deno seems to match import map qualifiers literally
      - If you have a setting for `lit-html/` for `lit-html/...` it won't match `lit`, and vice versa
      - But you can try to import `lit-html/` for the default, and it'll work out either way

- Lume is the best way to do web standard frontend on Deno
  - I can continue to work with (almost) web standard files but still use TypeScript and Deno default tooling
  - Lume can't re-parse `.html` files, but just renaming them to `.md` works fine
  - And we also get to generate static pages however we want, JSX or Lit-HTML
  - Lume's ESbuild plugin is the easiest way to process TypeScript dependencies
    - https://lume.land/plugins/esbuild/
    - It can even handle `npm:...` imports!
    - But it doesn't seem to be able to handle the Deno `npm:...` imports when delegated through an import map
      - In retrospect, that seems obvious
      - Deno's the one that translates `npm:...`s to ESM.sh URLs, which isn't happening at this stage
      - Solution is to simply use the ESM.sh URLs in the import map for frontend stuff, or just in general because I hate Deno's NPM import hacks

- Tina CMS is still the only sensible configurable Git-backed CMS out there
  - Especially as ~~Netlify CMS~~ Decap CMS continues to languish
  - But Tina is still a hassle to set up, especially in a Deno project
  - And the heavy-handed React integrations are cringe, even if it tries to be framework agnostic
    - The only way to customize the the editor widgets is through React, which I can frankly tolerate
